    "Decision trees are then trained independently on these subsets, leading to varied models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diversity in these models arises because each tree sees a different set of data points, making them\n",

    "Furthermore, bagging encourages model stability by averting an excessive reliance on any particular subset of \n",
