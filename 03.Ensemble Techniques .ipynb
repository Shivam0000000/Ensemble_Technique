    "Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging):\n",
    "Random Forest uses bootstrapping to create multiple subsets of the training data, each of which is used to train a\n",

    "that can lead to overfitting when a single decision tree is trained on the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Randomness:\n",
    "At each split point when constructing a decision tree, Random Forest randomly selects a subset of features to consider.\n",
    "This feature randomness ensures that the individual trees within the ensemble are not overly specialized to any\n",

    "Ensemble Averaging:\n",
    "In the final prediction stage, the Random Forest Regressor combines the predictions from multiple decision trees.\n",
    "Averaging these predictions helps to smooth out individual tree idiosyncrasies and reduces the variance in the model's\n",
    "predictions, making it less prone to overfitting.\n",
